B00MQ6U740,"Saw these on sale one day and immediately bought a pair because I've always wanted sunglasses of this style, plus I loved the crimson/black color scheme. For under $10, I figured I'd gamble with buying sunglasses online. After I took them out of the box, however, the first thing I noticed was that the plastic was very rigid and cheap-feeling and they were too small to fit on my face. I used them maybe two or three times over the course of a week and then came the big test: wearing them to an all-day music festival. After having them on for most of the day, I took them off while we got a little bit of rain. When the sun came back out, I grabbed these glasses, went to put them on my face, and the plastic rim snapped right above the right lens. Out of anger, frustration, and surprise, I shook my head and immediately threw them into the nearest trash can. I haven't owned many sunglasses in my time, but I don't think they're supposed to break that easily.<br /><br />I'd feel bad giving these just one star, only because they look great with the matte black plastic and the reflective crimson lenses. But, sadly, I cannot recommend them to anyone due to the lack of durability.","zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,"I disliked these sunglasses. I have a normal sized head, and they barely provide any protection from light. Light will get in from every side. It only protects your direct sight. I don't wear them at all. I have bought better sunglasses for less at Walgreens.","zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,The matte reflective lenses started to peel in a few places only a week after purchase. It's a cheap pair of glasses but I mean come on ive had $3 glasses that held up better. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product.,"zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,"Very plastic, lenses are blurry and do not block much of the sun. These are not really functional sunglasses.","zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,"You get what you pay for. It does not block sun rays and I cant see my golf ball after swing, so not good.","zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,They are great affordable glasses but they came with quite a bit of stuff on the lenses.,"zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"

B00MQ6U740,Broke after they fell once,"zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,"While I was wearing them on the beach in the sun, they literally snapped in half. I thought a seagull hit me in the face or something. Nope, I don't know how and I don't know why, but they just snapped. Maybe the sun heated them up? I don't know. I wasn't injured at all, and this seems like a fluke because all the other reviews seem to have no issues.<br /><br />Other than that though, I thought they were great, if not a little cheap. I got the Black Crimson ones and on the side there is a logo that says &#34;ZeroUV&#34; in red letters. Pretty minor, and only on one side.","zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,"Impulse buy. I don't like the base 4-5 frame type (flat, no facial curve).","zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
B00MQ6U740,They are quite snug. The hinges are tight and feel like they may break. The matte finish shows finger print oil badly.,"zeroUV ZV-8025c Retro Matte Black Horned Rim Flash Colored Lens Sunglasses, Black Crimson, 50mm"
