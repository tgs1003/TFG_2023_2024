B00JAILFY8,"Awful product literally broke within minutes of putting them on. The frame just cracked, I duct taped it and wore them and within 2 days the other side cracked in the same spot. I'm sending them back, obviously. Do not buy these.",Sun Shield Fit Over Sunglasses with Blue Blocker HD Driving Lens & Spring Hinges - Fit Over Prescription Glasses
B00JAILFY8,"Good fit. They broke within the first day I used them. I didn't drop them. I had them on and then next minute they fell off. It was so pathetic I had to laugh. The plastic around the lenses cracked and then the lenses also popped out. Anyway, yeah, 1 star.",Sun Shield Fit Over Sunglasses with Blue Blocker HD Driving Lens & Spring Hinges - Fit Over Prescription Glasses

B00JAILFY8,"I purchased these glasses in May.  Honestly, I did not wear them but once or twice.  I went to put them on the other day for the 3rd time and the frame is split with the lens falling out.  What a disappointment and it is too late to return them.  I am very frustrated because I could feel my eyes relieved of stress when I put the glasses on, but apparently they are so cheaply made that they break with little effort.  I do not have a home where children or pets are running around.  The frame just plain broke.",Sun Shield Fit Over Sunglasses with Blue Blocker HD Driving Lens & Spring Hinges - Fit Over Prescription Glasses
B00JAILFY8,"I bought two of these over the past 3 months and I would not recommend them to anyone.  They do a good job in providing a sun shading effect, however, both pair broke and the lenses fell out within only a few days of each other.  I wanted to return them but was told that there was no return policy.  CAUTION.  Do Not Buy This Product!!",Sun Shield Fit Over Sunglasses with Blue Blocker HD Driving Lens & Spring Hinges - Fit Over Prescription Glasses

B00JAILFY8,"Wow. These are my first &#34;blue-blocker, fit-over glasses. I decided to go cheap.<br /><br />I'm a careful person and I take care of my things. I had read the other 1-star reviews, so I knew I would need to be careful. And I was.<br /><br />For $17.97 I thought I could get more use out of these than I did. But I didn't make it through even 5 or 6 uses -- over 10 days or so -- before the left-side lens frame broke about 1 inch below the nose-fulcrum.<br /><br />Wow. Poor engineering, poor quality, poor materials. In my estimation, these glasses would be properly priced at $1.79 not $17.97.",Sun Shield Fit Over Sunglasses with Blue Blocker HD Driving Lens & Spring Hinges - Fit Over Prescription Glasses
B00JAILFY8,"These were not shoes, LOL!  (Survey asked me questions about shoes, which I had to answer in order to submit) I was disappointed that these glasses only partially block blue rays. I tested them on a couple of different blue spectrum test sites and they failed the test. On the test image below, both bars should appear identical when wearing the glasses. They do not.",Sun Shield Fit Over Sunglasses with Blue Blocker HD Driving Lens & Spring Hinges - Fit Over Prescription Glasses
