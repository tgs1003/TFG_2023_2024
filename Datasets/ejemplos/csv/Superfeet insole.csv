B0033BPBD4,It was too tight around the heel.,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,The inserts were marked and cut before I received them and did not fit into my boots.  I am very disappointed with the product.,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,Stops my foot pain from plantar fasciitis.,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"My podiatrist recommended I get these after suffering from 3 bouts of plantar fasciitis. My only complaint is that I don't feel as if they do much for my non existent arch, and they don't fit in many of the shoes that I usually wear because I can't replace the insoles. That's not the fault of the product, but I've only been able to test these with two shoes.<br /><br />I was able to go to the county fair this summer and stand around and walk in them for 6 hours, by which my feet were already hurting, but the next day there was no foot pain. I largely attribute that to the product.I did have to trim off a couple of inches to get it to fit my shoes, and I like that the heel cup is deep enough to help prevent your foot from slipping and rolling around inside the shoe.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"Having been told by a podiatrist that the only relief for my foot pain would be to purchase custom fit orthotics from him at a starting cost of $600, and not covered by insurance, I decided to look online for less expensive option.  Hello Superfeet!<br /><br />While I ordered the correct size, I found that the arch of the insole is farther forward than my actual arch is.  In order to have my arch meet the arch of the insole I would have to wear them with my foot at least a half inch forward of the heel cup.  Either way, the insole is uncomfortable for me.  I asked another family member to try them on, we wear about the same size shoe, and they had the same issue.  I opted to return the insoles.<br /><br />Having said that, they do seem to be very well constructed, I found the width to be perfect for me (I wear a N width), and with the current return policy, I am considering ordering another style.<br /><br />Update:  Based on my experience with the return, I will not be ordering another pair.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"I rate these as Okay. I've tried them in about 3 different pairs of boots. Some they help, some they make worse. They are not &#34;squishy&#34; or give that gel feeling AT ALL. They are actually pretty stiff, and do provide some support. I wouldn't necessarily recommend or not recommend them, feet comfort is one of those things you just have to try different things and footwear until you find what's best for you.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"Bought these inserts for USMC Bates Lites Boots.<br />I have high arches. I used these for two weeks before returning them.<br /><br />Seeing as how this was almost 3 times as more expensive as the next best option, I thought there would be some obvious indication distinguishing these inserts from the others.<br /><br />Alas, just like any other product that is overly-hyped by the easily fooled masses, it was quite a disappointment. Right out of the box, you notice that these &#34;premium&#34; inserts are constructed of cheap material that is borderline styrofoam. Talk about maximizing profit margin...<br /><br />Over the two week's use, i noticed the arch support is no different from other boot inserts i bought, and the cushioning is near non-existent.<br /><br />Yes, i would buy this as a decent, nothing special, replacement insert if this was $10.<br /><br />Hell no would i buy this for $45. It's a shame that most of the reviewers have fallen victim to the hype.<br /><br />If you're really intent on buying it, plan on returning it with the same disappointment that i expressed here.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"Good value, can be a little large if using with dress shoes (fit great in running shoes)",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,Use them in every shoe I can!  Great for Planter Fasciitis,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"I have these for some other shoes and I really like them.  The current pair is an 11.5 and I couldn't find a good fit, 11 was too small and 12 is too large.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,May return,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,will not ever buy a set of these overpriced insoles that made my feet hurt within 2 hrs....they suck!,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,Item arrived as described.,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"This insole is literally a glorified piece of cheap foam and plastic.  Looking underneath the sole, the gray piece is a hard plastic while the green portion is cheap hard foam.  I can not recommend this product & am returning it.  Don't buy into the 5 star hype.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,"These are not comfortable at all.  I figured spending $44 for insoles they would be comfortable, that was not the case.  The $12 insoles from the dept store are more comfortable.  Save your money and just buy a pair of Dr Scholls insoles.",Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
B0033BPBD4,These do make my feet feel better at the end of the day. Maybe could have been a little wider.,Superfeet GREEN Full Length Insole
