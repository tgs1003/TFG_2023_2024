What's the worst that could happen? Well the worst did happen! They came out of the box SCRATCHED, and I put them on my face and it was very noticeable. I then put them in my sweatshirt pocket (which is not tight at all I may add) and I went to put them on the next day and they were COMPLETELY BENT. I was not doing any crazy activities either with them in my pocket, I simply just layed in the bed of my truck at the drive-ins.
